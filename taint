kubectl taint nodes node1 key=value:NoSchedule

Taint-effect: NoSchedule,PreferNoSchedule, NoExecute

places a taint on node node1.
The taint has key key, value value, and taint effect NoSchedule. 

This means that no pod will be able to schedule onto node1 unless it has a matching toleration.

Note: Taint is the opposite of NodeAffinity,
however it does not guarantee that the pod to run in a particular node, it is the opposite logic,
you basically prevent a pod to run on a particular node, since it tells a node to accept pods that 
have only a particular tolleration

One example of usage: by default the master nodes have the taint "NoSchedule" applied
